# State of project
Minesweeper API is fine, you can use it wherever you want! Alhough, the graphic aspect of the game is raw right now, not all the functions are implemented, there is a lot to do, so **keep tuned**!

# How to run
To play the game you need to run `cargo run --release` in terminal in the project's folder

On start you can change width and height of Minesweeper's grid with your keyboard!
